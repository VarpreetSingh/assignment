      <div class="grid_8"><p>
        A business model is an "abstract representation of an organization, be it conceptual, textual, and/or graphical,
        of all core interrelated architectural, co-operational, and financial arrangements designed and developed by an
        organization presently and in the future, as well as all core products and/or services the organization offers,
        or will offer, based on these arrangements that are needed to achieve its strategic goals and objectives."
        This definition by Al-Debei, El-Haddadeh and Avison (2008) indicates that value proposition, value architecture (the organizational
        infrastructure and technological architecture that allows the movement of products, services, and information), value finance
        (modeling information related to total cost of ownership, pricing methods, and revenue structure), and value network articulate
        the primary constructs or dimensions of business models.A business model describes the rationale of how an
        organization creates, delivers, and captures value,[4] in economic, social, cultural or other contexts. The process of
        business model construction is part of business strategy. In theory and practice, the term business model is used
        for a broad range of informal and formal descriptions to represent core aspects of a business, including purpose, business
        process, target customers, offerings, strategies, infrastructure, organizational structures, sourcing, trading practices,
        and operational processes and policies including culture. The literature has provided very diverse interpretations and
        definitions of a business model. A systematic review and analysis of manager responses to a survey defines business models as
        the design of organizational structures to enact a commercial opportunity.[5] Further extensions to this design logic emphasize
        the use of narrative or coherence in business model descriptions as mechanisms by which entrepreneurs create
        extraordinarily successful growth firms.Business models are used to describe and classify businesses,
        especially in an entrepreneurial setting, but they are also used by managers inside companies to explore possibilities
        for future development. Well-known business models can operate as "recipes" for creative managers.[7] Business models
        are also referred to in some instances within the context of accounting for purposes of public reporting.
