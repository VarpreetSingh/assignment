      A business model is an "abstract representation of an organization, be it conceptual, textual, and/or graphical,
      of all core interrelated architectural, co-operational, and financial arrangements designed and developed by an
      organization presently and in the future, as well as all core products and/or services the organization offers,
      or will offer, based on these arrangements that are needed to achieve its strategic goals and objectives."
      This definition by Al-Debei, El-Haddadeh and Avison (2008) indicates that value proposition, value architecture (the organizational
      infrastructure and technological architecture that allows the movement of products, services, and information), value finance
      (modeling information related to total cost of ownership, pricing methods, and revenue structure), and value network articulate
      the primary constructs or dimensions of business models.A business model describes the rationale of how an
      organization creates, delivers, and captures value,[4] in economic, social, cultural or other contexts. The process of
      business model construction is part of business strategy. In theory and practice, the term business model is used
      for a broad range of informal and formal descriptions to represent core aspects of a business, including purpose, business
      process, target customers, offerings, strategies, infrastructure, organizational structures, sourcing, trading practices,
      and operational processes and policies including culture. The literature has provided very diverse interpretations and
      definitions of a business model. A systematic review and analysis of manager responses to a survey defines business models as
      the design of organizational structures to enact a commercial opportunity.[5] Further extensions to this design logic emphasize
      the use of narrative or coherence in business model descriptions as mechanisms by which entrepreneurs create
      extraordinarily successful growth firms.Business models are used to describe and classify businesses,
      especially in an entrepreneurial setting, but they are also used by managers inside companies to explore possibilities
      for future development. Well-known business models can operate as "recipes" for creative managers.[7] Business models
      are also referred to in some instances within the context of accounting for purposes of public reporting.
