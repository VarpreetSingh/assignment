          A business model is an "abstract representation of an organization, be it conceptual, textual, and/or graphical of all core interrelated architectural, co-operational, and financial arrangements designed and developed by an organization presently and in the future, as well as all core products and/or services the organization offers or will offer, based on these arrangements that are needed to achieve its strategic goals and objectives." This definition by Al-Debei, El-Haddadeh and Avison (2008) indicates that value proposition, value architecture (the organizational
          infrastructure and technological architecture that allows the movement of products, services, and information), value finance
          (modeling information related to total cost of ownership, pricing methods, and revenue structure), and value network articulate
          the primary constructs or dimensions of business models.A business model describes the rationale of how an
          organization creates, delivers, and captures value,[4] in economic, social, cultural or other contexts. The process of
          business model construction is part of business strategy. In theory and practice, the term business model is used
          for a broad range of informal and formal descriptions to represent core aspects of a business.
